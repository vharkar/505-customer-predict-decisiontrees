## View deployed app on Heroku: https://vibha-customer-decisiontree-classifcation.herokuapp.com/

This repo is a template for capstone presentations of machine learning. Though simple, it has several important features that should be imitated in any capstone:

* A cleaned dataset with a clearly defined problem and target variable.
* A machine learning algorithm that has been trained on a portion of the data, and tested on a set-aside portion.
* Evaluation metrics showing the performance of the model on the testing data.
* Individual results of the testing dataset, for further analysis of incorrect predictions.
* A feature whereby the model receives new user inputs and makes predictions based on the new data.
* An interactive user-interface deployed on a cloud platform and accessible to potential reviewers.
